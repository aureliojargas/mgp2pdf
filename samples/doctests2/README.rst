My EuroPython 2006 presentation

The .mgp file isn't the actual source; I used a Python script to generate
it from a simpler ad-hoc markup format (see source/Makefile).

The PDF file was generaded by mgp2pdf in 2006!  It worked better than
the corrent one!

Conversion: the PDF actually looks better than the original (MagicPoint
wraps text in the middle of a word!).  Some excepions:

- on pages 42 and 58, current mgp2pdf wraps the closing parenthesis of a
  Python expression (but mgp itself doesn't, and mgp2pdf in 2006 didn't
  also!).

- slide 71 also ought to fit (and fits with mgp)
