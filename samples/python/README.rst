Slides from my Python course at Vilnius University

I taught this course in 2004, 2005 and 2006.  These slides are from 2006.
More information available at http://gedmin.as/study/python/index-lt.html
(in Lithuanian).

Trivia: mgp2pdf was written in 2004 specifically so that I could publish
my slides.

(How did I handle UTF-8 in 2004?  I don't remember!)

The PDFs are from http://gedmin.as/study/python/slides/

Current mgp2pdf fails to convert the mgp files with an exception inside PIL!

Conversion issues:

- python2.pdf, slide 6: ideally there would be no word-wrapping.  (Original PDF
  from 2006 has the same problem, might be just a bug in my slides.  Maybe I
  used a different screen resolution during the presentation.)

- python3.pdf, slide 44: image positioning is wrong (was okay in 2006).

- python7.pdf, slide 33: image positioning is wrong (was okay in 2006).
