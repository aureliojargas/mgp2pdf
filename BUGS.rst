- samples/python/python3.mgp: slide 44 is rendered wrong,
  compared to the original PDF from 2006
- samples/python/python3.mgp: slide 44 was also rendered wrong a few days
  ago, and is rendered slightly less wrong now -- but text/image relative
  positioning was better a few days ago!  According to timestamps
  my old test files were rendered on 2014-12-04 10:26 +0200, which is
  after commit a480eb14e3cb8c1c560ca8039f591736b3f56f66, but I can't
  reproduce those buggy render using that commit :/
